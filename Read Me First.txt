Firstly, I am an Engineer not a programmer (even though PSC think I should be 'Advanced' by now!) I learnt VB just to do this project as, at the time, I couldn't find a programme to do the job. I had a lot of help and my thanks go to the people in the credits. Apologises to those people whose bits of code I have borrowed without a name to credit.

*********************

Half way through this project I changed to XP from '98SE. One problem I have still not sorted is the question of distribution. Various ways have been tried but '98 now comes up with error "NOT A FAT32 PROGRAM". Has anybody got a foolproof way of distribution over all platforms? I uploaded an article about .msi but I am not a lover of it! Should I be looking to do two versions, FAT32 and NTFS ? Your thoughts/ideas on the subject would be most welcome.

*********************

Before you attempt to load this project, 'MultiButtonControl.oc_' needs to be renamed and registered.
Rename to 'MultiButtonControl.ocx' before you attempt to register it. 

(If you do not know how to do this there are small projects to be found on PSC which can do it for you. Try doing a search for RegSvr.)

*********************

You should check your monitor on a regular basis (especially Moire patterning as it can give you headaches!) Hope you find this prog useful.
